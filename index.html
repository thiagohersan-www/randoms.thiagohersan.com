        <p>Consider a six-sided die. We'll assume this is a fair die, so when we roll it, each of its faces has an equal probability of showing up. We're going to throw this die many times and use the graph on the right to keep track of the total times each of the six faces is rolled.</p>

        <p>We can start by rolling the die <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">once</span>. Every time we click <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">here</span>, a roll is simulated and the resulting face is added to the graph. <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">Try it</span>.</p>

        <p>The rolling of the die is a random event. The result of each roll is independent of previous rolls and so knowing anything about the previous rolls doesn't give us any information about the next rolls. Individual rolls are not predictable.</p>

        <p>But this doesn't mean that there's nothing to be said about the collective behavior of a series of rolls. Since this is a fair die, if we keep rolling it, the total number of times each face is rolled will eventually approach the same value.</p>

        <p>We can speed up this process by simulating <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="2">two rolls</span> at a time, or even <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="10">10 rolls</span>. Even thought it initially might seem like one of the faces is prevalent, after 100s of rolls they all approach the same value.</p>

        <p>We can <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="-1">clear the graph</span> and start over, or simulate <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="100">100 rolls</span> or even <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="250">250 rolls</span> at once.</p>
        
        <p>Since the number of times each outcome shows up is the same, we call this type of random event uniform.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Sum of Two Uniform Distributions</div>

        <p>Let's imagine throwing a pair of six-sided fair dice. We're not going to read off their faces individually, but instead will sum the numbers rolled. Now, instead of six possible outcomes we have eleven possibilities: the numbers 2 through 12.</p>

        <p>Let's simulated a couple of <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">single rolls</span> of this pair of dice. Like before, we'll use the graph on the right to keep track of the total number of times each of the possible eleven outcomes shows up.</p>

        <p>Besides having a larger set of possible outcomes, something else that is different about this setup is that the possible outcomes are not equally likely to show up. There are more ways of rolling a 7 than a 2. There are more ways of rolling a 6 than a 3. This random event isn't uniform.</p>

        <p>Let's roll our pair of dice many times to see what happens in the long run. We can simulate a <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">single roll</span> at a time, but like before, we are interested in the long run behavior of our dice, so it might be more helpful to simulate <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="2">two rolls</span>, <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="10">ten rolls</span>, <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="100">100 rolls</span>, or even <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1000">1000 rolls</span> at a time. We can always <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="-1">reset</span> our experiment if we want to start over.</p>

        <p>After a few hundred rolls our graph should look symmetrical and slightly pyramidal. The most likely outcome, a sum of 7, should be six times more common than the least likely outcomes of 2 and 12. This is because there's only one way of rolling a 2 (a pair of 1s) and one way of rolling a 12 (pair of 6s), while there are six ways of rolling a sum or 7: (1,6) (2,5) (3,4) (4,3) (5,2) (6,1).</p>

        <p>By the same logic, the total number of times a sum of 3 is rolled is twice the number of times a sum of 2 is rolled and half the number of times a 5 is rolled. There are two ways of rolling a 3 (1,2) (2,1) and four ways of rolling a 5 (1,4) (2,3) (3,2) (4,1).</p>

        <div class="section-title">Gaussian Distributions</div>

        <p>What if we roll and sum up three six-sided fair dice rolled together? Let's simulate a few <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1">single rolls</span> and look at our graph as it accumulates the total number of times each outcome shows up. With three dice the total number of possible outcomes is 16: the sums 3 to 18. Like before, outcomes in the center of this range are more likely, while outcomes on the edges are more rare.</p>

        <p>Let's again simulate 100s or 1000s of rolls to get to our symmetric distribution graph. We can do this by doing <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="100">100 rolls</span> at once, or <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1000">1000 rolls</span>.</p>

        <p>There's nothing special about using <span class="dice-change" data-dice="2">two dice</span> or <span class="dice-change" data-dice="3">three dice</span>. We can simulate rolling <span class="dice-change" data-dice="4">four dice</span>, <span class="dice-change" data-dice="8">eight dice</span>, or even <span class="dice-change" data-dice="16">sixteen dice</span> at once, while keeping track of the sum of their faces using our graph on the right.</p>

        <p>As before, wwe can always <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="-1">reset</span> our experiment, or simulate <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="100">100 rolls</span> or <span class="dice-roll" data-rolls="1000">1000 rolls</span> at once.</p>

        <p>With more dice it takes more rolls to get to a pyramid-shaped graph, but it eventually shows up. Random events that have long-term outcomes with this kind of distribution are called normal or gaussian. Like uniform random events, there's no way of predicting the outcome of any single multi-dice roll, but over many rolls there are some very specific relationships we can expect to see from the cumulative behavior of our random events.</p>

        <p>Uniform and Normal distributions are the simplest ones to visualize and understand, but they are not the only types of distributions for random events. There are some other well defined distributions like x,y,z that can be used to model other kinds of random events and the long term cumulative behavior of their outcomes.</p>

        <p>Let's look at some distributions that have little to do with dice: images and their pixel values.</p>

        <p>Pixels on images are made up of 3 values that represent how much red, green and blue is present on the color of the pixel. Each of these values is stored as a number between 0 and 255, where 0 represents no contribution from that channel and 255 is the strongest amount of contribution that channel can have to the overall color of the pixel. If this sounds strange, we can use the interface on the right to look at examples and build some intuition about how computers represent colors.</p>

        <p>Let's consider only values from the red channel of images. Can we predict the amount of red at a given location for an image we haven't seen? Probably not. But, if we look at thousands and thousands of red pixel values for thousands of images, we might be able to say something about how their aggregate values are distributed.</p>

        <p>Let's consider a dataset of cloud images. It has 1000s of images of clouds, like these:</p>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <p>Each image is 128 pixels tall and 128 pixels wide for a total of 16,384 pixels. If we load these images, we can analyze each of their pixels and count how many times each of the 256 possible values show up. It's like each pixel is a roll of a 256-sided die and we want to know, in the long run, if the die is fair or if it follows a different kind of random distribution.</p>

        <p>We can start by loading and counting red values for a <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="1">single image</span>. Every time we hit the <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="1">single image</span> button a different image from our dataset is loaded and analyzed.</p>

        <p>Since we're interested in the long run, aggregate behavior of our random events, let's analyze <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="10">10 images</span>, <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="100">100 images</span>, or even <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="1000">1000 images</span> at a time. We can always <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="-1">reset</span> our experiment and our graph.</p>

        <p>After about one thousand images, the overall shape of our graph stops changing too much. It converges to the overall distribution of red-channel values for this dataset. In some ways this particular distribution looks like a wide gaussian, with a peak around the value 100.</p>

      <div class="section-canvas">
        <div class="container">

    <section class="section" data-pixel-section-idx="1">
      <div class="section-text">
        <div class="section-title">More Colors</div>

        <p>Not all channels will have the same distribution. Let's look at the pixel values of all 3 channels at the same time. In addition to counting how many times each of the 256 values show up on the red channel, we'll also separately keep track of the frequency of the values for the green and blue channels.</p>

        <p>We'll start by loading <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="1">single images</span>, but since we're interested in the cumulative behavior of our pixels, we can also speed up the process and analyze <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="10">10 images</span>, <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="100">100 images</span>, or <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="1000">1000 images</span> at once. <span class="pixel-roll" data-rolls="-1">Reset</span> clears our graph.</p>

        <p>For these cloud images, it seems like all 3 channels could be modeled as gaussian distributions. The peak of the blue channel (its average value) is slightly larger (further to the right) than the other two channels. This means that, on average, the blue channel contributes more than the other two channels to overall pixel colors. This makes intuitive sense given that these are pictures of clouds in the sky.</p>

        <p>Once thousands of images are analyzed, each of the datasets seem to converge to a specific, and yet different, distribution.

Other graphs seem to converge to something closer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution" target="_blank">Gamma distribution</a>.</p>
